# Snake - A Java Recreation of the Classic Game

## Description
A game of snake using Java. The game features a fully functional GUI with customizable game speed, and sound.

## About
I created this game during my first year of college, back in 2021. It was the second time I created a program that felt truly "complete" to me. With a fully functional GUI and settings to control game speed, difficulty, and sound, this project marked a milestone in my learning journey.

At the time, I had just learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and was really excited about implementing the concepts I had learned. Looking back, I can see how much I have improved since then, and while this program may not be as polished as the projects I work on today, I am still very proud of it. It was a another reminder of how far Iâ€™ve come.

## To Compile
To compile the Java files, use the following command:
```
javac -d out .\src\*.java
```

## To Run
Once the project is compiled, run the game with the following command:
```
java -cp out main
```

## Features
- Customizable difficulty settings.
- Sound effects for actions within the game.
- User-friendly GUI using javas Swing library to enhance the playing experience.
